## [1.0.3] - 2024-10-24

### Fixed

- When the "Include descriptions" setting is turned on it will now actually check if it was successful.



## [1.0.2] - 2024-10-23

### Added

- You can now search for the title of your current reputation standing/reaction, e.g. "Renown 10", "Collaborator", "Stranger", "Level 36", "True Friend", etc.

### Fixed

- Small performance improvements.



## [1.0.1] - 2024-10-04

### Fixed

- The rep bar will now only be tried to be added to the ReputationFrame once it's actually loaded and then only once (instead of every time you see a loading screen lol).



## [1.0.0] - 2024-10-03

### Changed

- Recoded the entire addon, now I just manipulate the update function of Blizzards ReputationFrame with an algorithm of my own.

- Searching for something now colors the part of the name of the faction you were searching for (e.g. searching for "War" colors the "War" part in "The War Within" green).



## [0.6.2] - 2023-10-14

### Changed

- Rewrote the option settings, since it was unreliable at best

### Fixed

- After your first install of the addon it would try to load some settings which obviously aren't there yet
